You have a business that might be doing well. But knowing when you are going to get maximum the crowd or when there is going to be a dry spell is a very important information to know. It prepares the entrepreneur to handle the big crowd during rush hours and alerts the user when should he go to a particular business to avoid a rush. This project will benefit both the user and the customer in shaping their schedule to the business. It will not only save customersâ€™ time but also benefit the business to perform well during the rush hours.
